#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
  
    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

    -Connect between the two instances.

## Steps:

1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
    
       gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud"  --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" 
     --subnet "default" --tags http

        gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http -- action=allow --destination=ingress --rules=http:80 -- target-tags=http


2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

        gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

        gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --
      subnet "default"

3. Connect between the two instances.
    
    1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
      
       -create to my-vm-2:
            
            gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
       
       -use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
            
            ssh my-vm-1

       -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

            sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
      -Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

                sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
      
     -Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

             Hi from YOUR_NAME
      -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

            curl http://localhost/

     - To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

           exit
     -To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

              curl http://my-vm-1/

     -Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
